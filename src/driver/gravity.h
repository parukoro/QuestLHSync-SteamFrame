// Gravity levelling, for one or two base stations. SteamVR levels its lighthouse frame by the base stations'
// accelerometers: half a degree or more off, and differently at every start. The cameras can't fix that with two
// stations (the room can turn about the line through them without either moving), and SteamVR re-places the second
// station by centimetres as it goes, so its place is no level either. A third station pins the level
// (Solver::Level); without one, gravity can: the lighthouse controllers' and trackers' accelerometers, through their
// poses, say which way up is in the room.
//
// The driver listens to each device's receiver (HID input reports, read only: nothing is sent, SteamVR's own
// connection is untouched), decodes the IMU samples (Watchman v2, as libsurvive does) and applies the device's
// factory calibration from SteamVR's config folder. Over each second, with R the IMU's turn from its pose, a its
// accelerometer and v the IMU's velocity (both from the poses):
//     sum R a dt - (v(t1) - v(t0)) = G T + (sum R dt) o + T b
// G is gravity, o the offset the factory calibration left (it moves as the device warms up) and b the sideways error
// of SteamVR's orientation of the device (it moves as SteamVR recalibrates the device's IMU). That's linear, and
// gravity stays put in the room while the offset turns with the device: devices that move and turn, as they do in
// use, tell them apart, and a device at rest is the same with v = 0. A Kalman filter follows G per SteamVR session
// (it re-tilts at every start), in the reference frame as the anchor alone places it: G is what the devices agree
// on. The offsets are kept (gravity.json) for the next session. The IMU's clock is mapped onto the poses' by the
// samples' arrival times and the gyro's turning against the orientations'.
